"""Trading Intelligence MCP — Background Workers Entry Point.

Starts all background workers that continuously collect market data,
news, sentiment, and compute trading signals 24/7.

Usage:

# Phase 30 (Y-29) — module-level shutdown hooks.
# The brief observed an unexplained 2h56m outage with no shutdown line
# in the log. Pre-fix: a SIGTERM (e.g., systemctl stop) bypassed the
# Python try/except/finally and the process exited silently. Post-fix:
# both atexit (any normal exit, including unhandled exceptions) and
# explicit SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers emit a CRITICAL line so post-mortem
# always knows WHY the worker stopped.
#
# Loguru file sinks are configured with ``enqueue=True`` for thread
# safety, which means writes go through a background queue. SIGTERM
# can kill the process before the queue flushes — so the WORKER_SIGNAL
# line would never reach disk via loguru alone. We therefore mirror
# the message via a synchronous fd write to BOTH stderr (unbuffered)
# and the routed workers.log file. Belt-and-braces: the log call still
# runs (best-effort), and the fd write guarantees the operator sees
# the line even if loguru's queue thread is killed mid-flight.
