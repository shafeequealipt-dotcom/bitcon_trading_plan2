"""Trailing-stop bracket simulator -- the "let winners run" exit style,
added specifically for the B1 follow-up (2026-09-28): the original B1 used a
fixed target (3x ATR), capping every winner at the same R-multiple. Classic
trend-following systems (Turtle/Donchian-style) instead let the position run
until the trend itself reverses, which is the entire point of trading a
breakout in the first place -- this module is that standard alternative,
not a re-tuned version of the fixed-bracket backtest.py.

Signal contract adds two fields to backtest.py's:
    trail_activate_pct   favorable move (percent of entry) required before
                          the trailing stop arms. Before that point only the
                          INITIAL stop_pct protects the position -- this
                          matches every production trailing-stop convention
                          in this codebase (see src/analysis/vol_scale.py)
                          and prevents ordinary noise from stopping out a
                          position before it has even confirmed the entry.
    trail_pct            distance the stop trails behind the best price
                          seen since entry, once armed. The stop can only
                          MOVE IN THE FAVORABLE DIRECTION once armed -- it
                          never loosens back toward entry.
No target_pct / max target -- the position runs to the trailing stop or
max_hold, whichever comes first. Same no-look-ahead contract as
backtest.py: fill is the OPEN of the bar after signal_ts; entry_ts <=
signal_ts raises.
