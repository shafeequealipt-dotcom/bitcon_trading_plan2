"""Bybit demo private-WebSocket subscriber.

Owns the lifecycle, message handlers, and idempotency dedup for the
Bybit-demo private push stream. Bridges pybit-thread events back to
the project's asyncio loop via ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``
and dispatches close-event data to ``TradeCoordinator.on_trade_closed``.

This module is the consumer side of the BybitWebSocket demo extension
(see ``src/trading/websocket.py``). It is constructed and owned by
``BybitDemoWSWorker`` (``src/workers/bybit_demo_ws_worker.py``); the
worker handles tick-driven health checks and reconnection.

P1 Phase 3b of the P1-P10 fix series. Replaces the watchdog poll-only
detection model with push notifications from Bybit's matching engine.

# receipt, so quiet periods register as "stale" even though TCP +
# pybit's own keepalive prove the socket is healthy. Bumping to 600 s
# (10 min) eliminates the spurious cycle while preserving the safety-
# net for genuinely dead connections: TCP keepalive at the OS layer and

    Lifecycle:
        1. ``connect()`` opens the private socket via BybitWebSocket and
           subscribes to position / execution / order topics.
        2. pybit pushes events to ``_handle_execution`` /
           ``_handle_position`` / ``_handle_order`` running in pybit's
           thread.
        3. Each handler defers async work back to ``self._loop`` via
           ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` so the project's
           coordinator (and downstream async DB callbacks) execute in
           the right event loop.
        4. ``disconnect()`` closes the socket on shutdown.

    Idempotency strategy (three layers; this class implements layer 1):
        - L1 (this class): ``_processed_closes`` TTL dedup keyed by
          ``(symbol, orderId)`` for ``_DEDUP_TTL_SECONDS`` to suppress
          Bybit-side duplicate execution events.
        - L2 (TradeCoordinator): atomic ``_trades.pop(symbol, None)``
          first-writer-wins; subsequent calls warn and return.
        - L3 (PositionWatchdog): ``is_symbol_in_any_cooldown`` cooldown
          gate (Issue 3, 2026-05-18) skips poll-side processing of
          WS-handled closes; previously ``is_symbol_cooled_down``.
