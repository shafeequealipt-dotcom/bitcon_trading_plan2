    first 10 minutes after a restart, upstream caches haven't fully
    populated yet (StructureCache, RegimeWorker per-coin, AltDataWorker
    F&G fetch), so packages routinely arrived at completeness 0.67 and
    the brain placed losing trades on incomplete data.

    This block configures the gate. It applies BEFORE Claude is called —
    if the gate trips, the cycle is short-circuited and a Telegram alert
    fires so the operator sees the silent skip.

            this value to allow execution. Default 0.70 (relaxed from
            0.85 by Issue E12 so honest failure-default scoring does not
            block the batch).
        min_per_package_completeness: Per-package floor used when

            the stricter ``boot_grace_completeness`` applies. Default
            600 s (10 min) — matches the typical warmup of the slowest

        state_sync_interval_sec: Disk/memory layer state sync heartbeat
            cadence. Every interval the LayerManager reads
            ``data/layer_state.json`` and compares to ``layer_active``

            ``"rewrite_disk"`` (default, post-fix): MEMORY is the live

                direction=memory_to_disk``. Correct because: persist
                failures should be RECOVERED by re-attempting the
                persist, not by undoing the in-memory state. The
                pre-fix behaviour silently dropped operator toggles
                because a stale on-disk snapshot would overwrite the
                just-toggled memory state within ~30 s.

            ``"reload_memory"`` (legacy, pre-fix): DISK is the source
                of truth. On drift, overwrite memory from disk. Kept
                only as an emergency rollback in case the rewrite-disk
                semantics surface a pathology in the field. Operators
                should NOT use this in normal operation — it's the

    Pre-fix, ``SignalGenerator._evaluate_signal()`` used sentiment as a
    HARD gate: every BUY/SELL rule required ``abs(sentiment) > 0.2``.
    With sentiment=0.0 in 97.9% of coins (Reddit disabled + Finnhub no
    altcoin coverage), all signals fell through to NEUTRAL by design.

    The post-fix evaluator computes a weighted direction_score across
    four components (sentiment, F&G contrarian, funding rate, OI change)
    where each is "active" only if abs(score) >= its min threshold.
    A component with no data (sentiment=0.0) is INACTIVE — does NOT
    pull toward NEUTRAL — so other strong signals can derive direction
    independently.

        sentiment_min_active: Minimum abs(sentiment) for sentiment to

        fg_min_active: Minimum abs(fg_score) for F&G to participate.

        oi_min_active: Minimum abs(oi_score) for OI change to
            participate. Default 0.20.
        sentiment_weight: Weight in the rebalanced weighted sum.

class EntryVolumeGateSettings:
    """Entry Quality Gates — volume-ratio (2026-07-15), ATR (2026-07-16),
    recent-loss (2026-07-17).

    Three independent entry-time gates share this settings section and
    the ``strategy_worker`` wiring. Volume-ratio and ATR read from the
    same TA-cache call; recent-loss reads a direct DB query. Each gate
    has its own enable/threshold/mode so any one can enforce while
    another observes.

    ## Volume-ratio gate (deployed, enforcing)

    A 371-trade VM analysis (2026-07-11..14, ``trade_intelligence``) found
    that ``volume_ratio`` at entry (current M5 volume vs its SMA) separates
    winners from losers — the first entry-time feature to do so, after the
    June diagnosis found none. ``vr >= 0.4`` split the book +$49.31 kept vs
    -$71.17 dropped, and the effect survived five robustness checks
    (per-day, leave-one-symbol-out, within-symbol, threshold sensitivity,
    chronological halves). See IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE.md for the full
    evidence and phased rollout plan. Later correction (see
    IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_QUALITY_SELECTIVITY.md §1b/§4): the live entry-time
    gate log shows no gradient above the 0.30 floor (the original
    separation was partly a close-time capture artifact) — kept as a
    dead-tape floor, not tuned upward.

    ## ATR gate (2026-07-16)

    A 342-trade analysis (2026-07-13..16, split at the R:R fix deploy)
    found entry ATR% is a strong, monotonic selector: near-flat coins
    (ATR < 0.20%) lose money as a cohort across two independent windows;
    genuinely moving coins (ATR >= 0.20%) carry the entire post-fix
    profit. See IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_QUALITY_SELECTIVITY.md §1a for the full
    evidence. Operator directed shipping directly to ``atr_mode="enforce"``
    on first deploy (see that doc §2 point 4 / §3 Phase A for the
    accepted risk — the filter partly selects *which coins are moving*
    rather than being validated within-symbol).

    ## Recent-loss gate (2026-07-17)

    A forensic trace of GWEIUSDT's post-ATR-gate trades found the system
    already has TWO mechanisms meant to prevent same-direction repeat
    losses (a brain-prompt ``RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN`` rule, and a scanner
    qualitative blocker at ``recent_failure_blocker_hours=1``) — neither
    stopped three consecutive GWEIUSDT shorts from closing at -1.76%,
    -1.90%, -1.94% within 59 minutes of each other. One surviving thesis
    literally reads "Despite RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN, the setup quality is
    B...". The prompt rule is advisory (the model can rationalize past
    it); the scanner blocker is upstream and can be routed around. This
    gate is last-mile — same execution point as the other two, after
    every upstream check has already passed. See
    IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_QUALITY_SELECTIVITY.md §8 for the full trace.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Master switch for the volume-ratio gate machinery
            (observability + enforcement). False = that gate's code path
            never runs. Does not affect the ATR or recent-loss gates.
        mode: "observe" (log would_block, never skip) or "enforce"
            (actually skip trades below the threshold) — volume-ratio gate.
        min_volume_ratio: Trades with volume_ratio below this are
            flagged/blocked. 0 = gate is a no-op even when enabled and in
            enforce mode (instant kill switch without touching `enabled`).
        atr_enabled: Master switch for the ATR gate machinery.
        atr_mode: "observe" or "enforce" — ATR gate.
        min_atr_pct: Trades with entry ATR% below this are flagged/blocked
            (dead-tape floor). 0 = no-op kill switch.
        recent_loss_enabled: Master switch for the recent-loss gate.
        recent_loss_mode: "observe" or "enforce" — recent-loss gate.
        recent_loss_lookback_hours: Window to count losses on the same
            (symbol, direction) pair. Matches the existing (advisory)
            RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN rule's own "within 1h" window.
        max_recent_losses: Block once the same-(symbol,direction) loss
            count within the lookback reaches this many. 1 = zero-
            tolerance re-entry (matches the prompt rule's intent
            exactly — this gate ENFORCES what the prompt only asks for).
            0 = no-op kill switch.
        symbol_breaker_enabled: Master switch for the symbol
            circuit-breaker gate (2026-08-02).
        symbol_breaker_mode: "observe" or "enforce" — circuit-breaker gate.
        symbol_breaker_lookback_hours: Window to sum losses on this
            symbol (any direction). 48h implements a rolling "48h ban" —
            once the offending losses age out of the window, the gate
            reopens on its own.
        symbol_breaker_max_cumulative_loss_usd: Block once cumulative
            loss magnitude on this symbol within the lookback reaches
            this many dollars. <= 0 disables this check only (the count
            check below still applies independently).
        symbol_breaker_max_loss_count: Block once the loss count on this
            symbol within the lookback reaches this many. <= 0 disables
            this check only. Both thresholds <= 0 is a full kill switch.
        min_move_enabled: Master switch for the minimum-expected-move
            fee gate (2026-08-02).
        min_move_mode: "observe" or "enforce" — min-move gate.
        min_move_fee_multiple: The REALISTIC capture (the adaptive-exit
            arm level, = max(arm_r x ATR%, fee_floor)) must be at least
            this many multiples of
            ``settings.adaptive_exit.round_trip_fee_pct`` (the shared
            measured constant, not a duplicate). <= 0 is a no-op kill
            switch. 2026-08-15 (Phase 2): 3.0 -> 2.5. With the fee
            corrected to its measured 0.24% and arm_r=1.5, a multiple of
            2.5 requires arm >= 0.60%, i.e. an effective ATR floor of
            0.40% -- the point where bucketed live data stops being
            net-negative after costs, while still keeping ~60% of trades.
            (3.0 would imply ATR >= 0.48% and keep only ~49%; that felt
            like over-tightening on PRE-Phase-1 capture economics.)

    Cross-check fix on top of Phase 2 of dir-block-fix (2026-05-05):
    pre-fix the builder used an explicit-arg pattern that omitted three
    fields the dataclass declares — ``min_distance_atr_multiplier``,
    ``min_distance_abs_floor_pct``, and ``min_distance_class_ceiling``.
    Operator tuning of those keys in ``config.toml`` was silently ignored.

    Owner-switch audit fix (2026-06-15): the prior ``hasattr(SLGatewaySettings,
    k)`` filter still silently dropped every field declared with
    ``field(default_factory=...)`` — because a factory-default installs NO
    class-level attribute, so ``hasattr`` is False for it. That dropped the
    owner-switch bucket lists (head/green/red/advisory/always) AND the
    pre-existing ``min_distance_class_ceiling`` sub-table, making those
    config.toml keys dead documentation (the dataclass defaults always won).
    Filtering on the dataclass FIELD NAMES instead makes every declared field —
    scalar and factory-default alike — load from config, so the buckets are
    genuinely tuning-ready (Rule 9). Behavior is unchanged today because the
    config lists/ceilings were byte-identical to the defaults; this makes future
    operator edits actually take effect.
