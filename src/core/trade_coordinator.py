"""TradeCoordinator — Shared state between Brain, Watchdog, Enforcer, and all trading components.

Solves the scoping problem: BrainV2 is a service, Watchdog is a worker, Enforcer is in strategies.
They can't reference each other directly. TradeCoordinator is registered in ServiceContainer
and passed to ALL components that need coordination.

Usage:
    coordinator = services.get("trade_coordinator")
    coordinator.register_trade("BTCUSDT", "momentum")
    coordinator.is_immune("BTCUSDT")
    coordinator.on_trade_closed("BTCUSDT", 1.5, 50.0, True)

        """Resolve authoritative ``pnl_usd`` / ``pnl_pct`` for a self-initiated close.

        The price-source-divergence forensic
        (``dev_notes/price_source_divergence/FULL_BUNDLE.md``) found that
        self-initiated close sites in ``position_watchdog`` and ``profit_sniper``
        were persisting locally-computed P&L (derived from
        ``pos.unrealized_pnl``, which is the Transformer-overwritten value)
        instead of Shadow's authoritative ``virtual_positions.net_pnl_usd``
        post-fee post-slippage figure. The external-detection path at
        ``position_watchdog.py:2569-2578`` already had a fix that prefers
        Shadow's net values via ``get_last_close``; this helper extends the
        same pattern to the 11 self-initiated close sites identified by
        the Phase 0 grep survey.

        Behaviour:

        - Shadow paper-trading mode: calls ``position_service.get_last_close
          (symbol)``. The proxy at ``transformer.py:1020-1030`` forwards to
          ``ShadowPositionService.get_last_close`` which queries Shadow's
          ``GET /api/position/{sym}/last_close`` and returns the
          authoritative virtual_positions row (post-fee, post-slippage).
          When the dict is well-formed, returns ``(net_pnl_usd, net_pnl_pct,
          "exchange_authoritative", exit_price)``. (The label was renamed
          from ``"shadow_authoritative"`` in P2 of P1-P10 — the resolved
          data applies equally to Shadow, Bybit demo, and Bybit live
          authoritative stores; the old name was misleading.)

        - Bybit live mode: the underlying ``PositionService`` has no
          ``get_last_close`` method, so the proxy returns ``None``. In this
          mode the helper falls back to the caller-supplied locally-computed
          values with ``price_source="local_fallback"``. Live mode does not
          have the slippage/fee-simulation gap so the local computation is
          itself authoritative there (Bybit's order response carries the real
          fill price).

        - Shadow transport / race failures: rare per Shadow's
          ``order_engine.close_position`` which commits the close row
          *before* returning the HTTP response, so the row is queryable by
          the time ``close_position`` returns. Network blips, Shadow DB
          locks, or service restarts can still cause ``get_last_close`` to
          return ``None`` or raise; the helper falls back to local with a
          WARNING log so reconciliation problems are visible.

        Args:
            symbol: Trading pair, e.g. ``"BTCUSDT"``.
            position_service: The position service the caller already
                holds (typically the Transformer's ``_PositionProxy``).
                Must expose ``async get_last_close(symbol)`` or equivalent;
                missing method falls back silently.
            fallback_pnl_usd: Locally-computed ``pnl_usd`` to use when
                Shadow data is unavailable. Typically ``pos.unrealized_pnl``
                from the closing site.
            fallback_pnl_pct: Locally-computed ``pnl_pct`` for the same
                fallback path.
            fallback_exit_price: Optional locally-known exit price to fall
                back to. ``None`` when the caller has none to offer.

        Returns:
            Tuple ``(pnl_usd, pnl_pct, price_source, exit_price)``.
            ``price_source`` is one of:

            - ``"exchange_authoritative"`` — values resolved from the
              active exchange's authoritative store (Shadow's
              ``virtual_positions`` for shadow mode, Bybit demo's
              ``/v5/position/closed-pnl`` for bybit_demo). ``exit_price``
              is the exchange's authoritative post-slippage fill price.
              (Renamed from ``"shadow_authoritative"`` in P2 of P1-P10.)
            - ``"local_fallback"`` — exchange returned ``None``, raised,
              or returned malformed data. Tuple carries the caller's
              fallbacks.

        The bybit_demo WS execution path used to call ``on_trade_closed``
        with a zero sentinel, so the coordinator back-derived a GROSS,
        fee-free PnL from entry/exit prices. Confirmed from the real
        wallet: that booked +$65 for a window while the wallet lost
        ~$2,274. This wrapper resolves the exchange's real ``closedPnl``
        (net of fees) via the already-trusted
        :meth:`resolve_authoritative_pnl` over the coordinator's own
        late-bound transformer (the same path the watchdog uses, proven
        live by WD_LAST_CLOSE_AUTH), then books that net number so every
        downstream sink and consumer sees the truth.

        Fallback: if no transformer is wired, or the exchange returns no
        data (indexer lag, transport blip), this degrades to the prior
        sentinel/back-derive behaviour (pnl_pct=0 + exit_price) so the
        close is never lost — only its precision regresses to gross, and
        the PNL_RECONCILE log will surface the residual.
