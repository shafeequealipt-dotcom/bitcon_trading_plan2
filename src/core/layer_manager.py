        step right after it does (``wait_for(_execute_new_trades,
        timeout=300)``). A single stuck await inside prompt-build (unbounded
        market-data/TA/volatility-profile lookups — see
        ``_build_trade_prompt``) froze new-trade-finding for 22h (2026-08-05)
        and 71.6h (2026-09-23->26) while the process stayed otherwise
        healthy: systemd's watchdog only sees whether the event loop is
        ticking at all, not whether ANY specific coroutine is stuck, so it
        never fired. Both freezes were found only because the operator asked
        for status; neither left any trace of WHERE the hang was.

        ``[brain].call_a_timeout_seconds`` (default 900s / 15min — see the
        config comment for the measured duration baseline this is sized
        against) bounds this call. On timeout: the stuck task's stack is
        logged BEFORE it is cancelled — a plain ``wait_for()`` cancels
        automatically and never gives the caller that chance, which is
        exactly why neither prior freeze could be diagnosed — then the task
        is cancelled and awaited so ``create_trade_plan``'s own
        ``finally`` still emits its paired ``STRAT_CALL_A_END`` (status=
        cancelled), matching the G1 try/finally-pairing contract that
        section documents. Raises TimeoutError so the caller's existing
        ``except Exception`` handling (BRAIN_CYCLE_A_FAIL, cycle-time
        bookkeeping, advance to Call-B) applies unchanged — this function
        adds a bound, not a new failure path.

        <= 0 disables the guard and restores the prior unbounded await.

            sym: Symbol of the rejected directive.
            direction: Original brain-proposed direction (``Buy``/``Sell``/``?``).

                ``order_reject``, ``exception``, etc.).

            blocker_layer: Which architectural layer absorbed the directive.
                One of: ``halt`` (pre-loop pnl/enforcer halt),
