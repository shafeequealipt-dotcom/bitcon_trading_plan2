"""Daily universe-refresh orchestration (Phase 2).

Wires the proven Phase 1 selection engine into the live system, safely. A
refresh:

  1. Pauses ONLY Call-A (find-new-trades) via a shared state flag. Call-B
     (manage open positions) and the position watchdog keep running, so open
     positions are never neglected.
  2. Runs the two-pass selection (open-position coins and any stable core
     force-kept).
  3. Applies the new universe in memory (reassigns ``settings.universe`` so
     the per-tick readers KlineWorker and ScannerWorker pick it up, and calls
     ``MarketScanner.set_watch_list`` for the scanner's own frozen copy) and
     persists it to ``data/universe_state.json`` for restart durability.
  4. Runs a DATA-GATED warm-up: waits until the newly-added coins' analysis
     passes the existing freshness gates (confirmed regime plus a minimum
     kline count), resuming early when ready, with a hard maximum.
  5. Resumes Call-A.

Safety invariants (implement-doc Rules 2, 3, 9):
  - Only Call-A is paused; everything else keeps running. Call-A is ALWAYS
    resumed, even if the refresh errors (try/finally).
  - If open positions cannot be confirmed, the refresh aborts WITHOUT
    swapping the universe (it never risks dropping a live position's coin).
  - It changes only the contents of the 50; it adds no per-trade gate and
    touches no exit system, the brain logic, or any protected table.
