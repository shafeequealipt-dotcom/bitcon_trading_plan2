"""Mode 4: ProfitSniper — institutional-grade profit protection.

Monitors open positions every 5 seconds using five mathematical models:
  1. Hurst Exponent (trend persistence / mean-reversion detection)
  2. Momentum Decay (multi-scale PnL deceleration detection)
  3. ATR Extension (volatility-normalized distance from entry)
  4. Volume Divergence (Wyckoff-derived OBV divergence)
  5. Risk/Reward Shift (forward expected value computation)

Models are combined with regime-aware dynamic weights (Phase 7).
Actions are determined by regime-aware thresholds + anti-greed backstop (Phase 9).
Trailing stops are ATR-based with profit decay and momentum adjustment (Phase 8).

Runs in parallel with Modes 1-3:
  Mode 1 (Passive/Claude): strategic decisions every 30 seconds
  Mode 2 (Safety Net): rule-based when Claude offline
  Mode 3 (Emergency): close all when system in danger
  Mode 4 (Profit Sniper): institutional profit protection every 5 seconds

Build phases: M1=foundation, M2=price buffer, M3=models, M4=scoring,
              M5=execution, M6=Claude (removed), M7=recording, M8=integration,
              M9=action engine, M10=integration+observability

Current phase: M10 (COMPLETE — full institutional-grade rebuild)

        Layer 3 hardening:
          - Bug 2 guard (inline, defense-in-depth): refuses to push a
            trail SL that would LOOSEN the current Shadow SL. Cheap and
            makes log diagnostics clearer (``M4_TRAIL_SKIP`` distinguishes
            Sniper's pre-check from a gateway reject).
          - Bug 1 sync: on success, mirrors the new SL onto the local
            TradePlan so downstream gates (sl_buffer_ok, etc.) see truth.
          - Bug 4 obs: failures are logged at warning level.

        SL Hierarchy overhaul (2026-04-22):
          - **Profit gate** at the top: trail is *profit protection*, not
            risk management. If the position is losing, skip the entire
            compute. The 5 math models and trail computation run in
            ``_compute_trail_stop`` regardless; this gate only blocks the
            push. (The Phase-9 ``_determine_action`` gate already blocks
            full closes on losing positions; this duplicates the
            discipline at the Phase-8 trail level.)
          - **Gateway routing**: when ``self.sl_gateway`` is injected,
            the wire push + tighten-only + min-distance + max-step +
            rate-limit rules are delegated to the gateway. Legacy body
            preserved as fallback for the ``sl_gateway=None`` case
            (e.g. unit tests without DI).

        Args:
            symbol: Trading pair.
            trail: Computed trail stop from ``_compute_trail_stop``.
            symbol_price: THIS symbol's live market price, re-read from
                its own ring buffer by the M5 caller (not the stale
                function-scope ``current_price`` from the M3/M4 loop).

        Note: when the Profit-Fetching Exit System is enabled, the score-path
        callers in ``_execute_action`` skip this method — the spine
        (``_pf_apply_spine``) owns all per-tick stop-raising, so there is a
        single stop-writer. This method stays directly callable for the legacy
        (disabled) path and for unit tests of its internal mechanics.

        """Escalate when actionable+hold persists for many consecutive ticks.

        The brief's observed RAREUSDT case: 114 sniper evaluations all
        scored ``actionable=True`` while the action engine voted ``hold``
        because the score sat just below the close threshold. The
        ``actionable`` flag was added as a signal but no dispatcher
        consumed it — write-only telemetry. This method bridges the gap.

        Counter is stored on the per-symbol ``tracked`` dict so it
        survives across sniper ticks but disappears with the position.

        Phase 4A (session-stability) — de-escalation guards:

        1. After an escape action is emitted the method falls silent for
           ``stall_escape_cooldown_seconds`` so downstream dispatch does
           not fire ``partial_close`` on every tick. This stops the 20×
           ``PARTIAL_CLOSE_UNSUPPORTED`` spam observed on MOVRUSDT.
        2. Each Shadow-downgraded tighten_agg is counted against
           ``stall_tighten_max_applications``. Once the cap is reached and
           PnL has not recovered by at least
           ``stall_recovery_threshold_pct`` from the worst-observed PnL,
           the method escalates straight to ``full_close`` (logged as
           ``MODE4_STALL_ESCALATE``) rather than emitting another
           partial_close that Shadow will silently swallow.

        Layer 4 Realignment Phase 1A (2026-05-06) — minimum-age guardrail:

        Before any stall-counter logic runs, the position's age is
        consulted. A position younger than
        ``settings.layer4_sniper.min_age_seconds`` (default 300 s, mirror
        of the watchdog's ``strategic_action_min_hold_seconds`` and
        time-decay's ``min_age_seconds``) returns immediately without
        touching the stall counter or any escape decision. This holds
        the sniper to the same 5-minute settling contract as the other
        Layer 4 close paths so fresh trades cannot be force-closed by
        the sniper before they have had time to develop. ``trade_coord``
        returns 99999 s for unregistered positions; that high value
        passes the guard naturally so untracked positions fall through
        to the existing logic.

        ``check_profit=False`` because the sniper's existing profit
        gate (line 1571) and Phase 1C guards already filter winners;
        re-checking here would emit duplicate guard logs.
        ``check_structural=False`` because the sniper does not own a
        TimeDecayState; the structural check is layered on the
        watchdog/time-decay path which DOES have anchors.

        When ``layer4_protection`` is None (legacy boot order or
        tests building the sniper directly), this method emits
        SNIPER_PROTECTION_SERVICE_UNWIRED at ERROR level and refuses
