"""Scanner Worker: cycle trigger that selects the cycle's 30 from the warm 50.

Corrected Layer 1 architecture (LAYER1_CORRECTED_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md §9):

  ScannerWorker is NOT one of the 7 data workers. It is a SEPARATE cycle
  trigger that wakes once per 5-min window at sweet spot 4:00, reads the
  warm caches the 7 workers maintain for all 50 coins, computes a
  composite opportunity score per coin, picks the 30 with highest scores
  (force-including any coin with an open position per HR-3), writes those
  30 to the ``active_universe`` table, and updates ``MarketScanner._active_universe``
  so Stage 2's ``await scanner.get_active_universe()`` reads them.

The previous implementation called ``MarketScanner.scan_market()`` which
issued a fresh Bybit REST ``get_all_linear_tickers`` call and scored on
raw market data (volume, spread, change). That path is bypassed here.

             CoinPackage. The package already carries state_label and
             interestingness_score from the Phase 3/4 wiring inside
             ``_build_package``.
          4. Sort by interestingness_score descending. Take
             ``top_n_packages`` (default 15). Apply soft floor:
             pad up to ``min_briefing_packages`` (default 12) from the
             top of the unselected tail so the brain ALWAYS sees >=12.

             always present in the selection regardless of rank.
          6. Validate each package; quarantine FAILs (same semantics as
             exclusion mode). Write surviving packages to
             ``lm._coin_packages``.
          7. Stamp CycleTracker briefing aggregates so the hourly
             ``cycle_metrics`` flush populates the new columns from
             Phase 1.
          8. Same active_universe DB write + ``set_active_universe``

        * ``"exclusion"`` (production default; this method's body below)
          runs the legacy 5-criterion qualitative gate followed by
          ranking of survivors. Behavior is byte-identical to pre-Phase-5
          production.

        * ``"briefing"`` calls ``_tick_briefing_mode`` instead — the
          briefing pipeline scores every coin by interestingness, takes
          top-N with a soft floor, and surfaces packages for ALL of
          them (no exclusion). Phase 9 flips the default after Phase 8
          A/B observation.

        Flow (exclusion mode — preserved):
          1. Read watch_list (50 coins).
          2. Fetch open positions (force-include, HR-2).
          3. For each coin, run ``_qualifies()``:
             - XRAY setup_type != NONE
             - Ensemble consensus in {STRONG, GOOD}
             - Regime aligns with proposed direction
             - RR ratio ≥ ``min_rr_ratio``
             - No blockers (funding, manipulation, recent loss)
          4. For every qualifier OR force-included coin, compute the
             composite ``_compute_opportunity_score`` (reused; matches
             the old scoring formula exactly).
          5. Sort survivors descending. Take top ``max_selection``; if
             fewer than ``min_selection`` qualified, output what we have
             (could be 0 — Stage 2 handles "no setups this cycle").
          6. Persist active_universe + MarketScanner._active_universe.
