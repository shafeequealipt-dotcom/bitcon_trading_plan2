"""Strategy Worker: runs the full Layer 1-4 pipeline for the watch_list.

Corrected Layer 1 architecture (LAYER1_CORRECTED_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md):
- Operates on ``config.universe.watch_list`` (50 coins).
- Fires at sweet spot ``settings.workers.sweet_spots.strategy_worker``
  (default ``"1:30"``) within every 5-min window — last in the chain
  before ScannerWorker reads everyone's outputs at 4:00.

Flow: PnL check -> get universe -> get regime -> prefetch data ->
      Layer 1 (scan) -> Layer 2 (score) -> Layer 3 (ensemble) ->
      apply restrictions -> Layer 4 (Rule Engine — uses cached Claude plan)

    """Pure Fix-7 (2026-06-10) math: widen the entry stop to the coin's
    volatility target and apply the tighten-only size haircut.

    The target stop distance is the profiler's ``recommended_sl_pct`` floored at
    ``reference_stop_pct`` (so a quiet coin keeps the existing minimum — the stop
    is never tightened below it) and capped at ``max_cap_pct``. If the placed
    stop is already at/beyond the target, it is unchanged. The size is then cut
    so the dollar risk AT the (possibly wider) stop equals what it would have
    been at the reference distance with the original size — i.e.
    ``size * leverage * stop_fraction`` is held at the reference budget. The cut
    is tighten-only (never scales size up), so the per-trade margin cap still
    binds.

    ``recommended_sl_pct <= 0`` means "no profiler input" -> the target defaults
    to the reference floor (no widening, no haircut).

    Returns ``(new_sl, new_size_usd, target_pct, final_pct)``.

        """Compute the XRAY override threshold from per-direction WR.

        R3 direction-fix (2026-05-17). Queries trade_log for the last
        N closed trades and computes win rate per direction. The
        threshold for overriding INTO ``flipped_dir`` derives as:

            threshold = wr_base * (1 - flipped_dir_wr_fraction)

        bounded by [floor, ceiling]. With neutral 50% WR the threshold
        equals wr_base * 0.5 (the midpoint of the legacy 3-10x dead
        zone). With high flipped-dir WR the threshold drops (easier
        to override into the better-WR direction). Same direction-
        agnostic formula applies whether flipped_dir is Buy or Sell;
        the asymmetry between them comes from the data, not the code.

        Cold-start fallback: when fewer than wr_window_min recent
        trades exist for the relevant direction, return the legacy
        static ``xray_lock_override_ratio_threshold`` (default 10.0)
