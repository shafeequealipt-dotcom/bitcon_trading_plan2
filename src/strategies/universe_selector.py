"""Dynamic universe selector — the movement-score engine.

The selection engine for the daily universe-refresh feature. It rebuilds
the contents of the trading universe around coins in a genuine active
phase, selected on MULTI-DAY activity (never the last-24h move, which
catches exhausted pumps).

Why a two-pass hybrid (operator-approved): the single bulk ticker call
(``MarketService.get_all_linear_tickers``) carries only 24-hour figures
(``high_24h``/``low_24h``/``change_24h_pct``/``volume_24h``), and the
system stores multi-day candles only for the current watch_list, not the
~582 tradeable coins. So a single bulk call cannot produce a multi-day
score. Instead:

  Pass one (cheap, all coins): apply the hard liquidity floor (dollar
  volume, spread, price) from the bulk tickers, then coarse-rank the
  survivors by 24h activity and keep the top ``shortlist_size``.

  Pass two (bounded, shortlist only): fetch multi-day daily candles (and
  open interest) for the shortlist and compute the true multi-day score —
  recent realized volatility (the backbone, highest weight) plus a volume
  surge and open-interest expansion, the whole gated by a directionality
  filter that drops choppy whipsaw coins and demotes the rest.

This module is PURE and IO-free except through injected async fetchers, so
it is unit-testable and can be proven offline before it touches the live
universe (implement-doc Rule 6). It constructs the universe between
trading; it is NOT a per-trade gate (Rule 2).

Honest limit (Rule 16): this picks coins with a much-better-than-random
chance of moving; it cannot pick the day's best 50 in advance.
