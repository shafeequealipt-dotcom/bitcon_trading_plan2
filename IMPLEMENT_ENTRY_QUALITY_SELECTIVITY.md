# IMPLEMENT: Entry-Quality Selectivity — fewer trades, higher accuracy

> **Status:** Phase A deployed + verified live (§7). Phase B/C investigated, not implemented (§6). Recent-loss gate added 2026-07-17 following a live forensic trace of the ATR gate's first bad stretch — deployed, see §8.
> **Date:** 2026-07-16 (updated 2026-07-17)
> **Operator goal (verbatim intent):** fewer trades is fine; improve accuracy, take only confident setups, make genuine PnL. No indiscriminate trade-pulling.
> **Evidence base:** 342 trades Jul 13–16 (`trade_intelligence`, split at the R:R fix deploy 2026-07-14T19:05 UTC), 546 live entry-gate evaluations, honest entry-time joins.
> **Builds on:** `IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE.md` (gate machinery, deployed + verified), `ENTRIES_QUALITY_DIAGNOSIS.md` (exits exonerated; entries are the problem).

## 0. Where the system stands (post-R:R-fix, 214 trades)

The R:R fix worked: win 56.1%, avg win +0.385% / avg loss −0.398% (≈1.0x,
was 0.64x), **net +8.80%** vs −3.31% pre-fix. The book is now profitable but
carries a heavy drag: roughly half the trades (the low-quality half) lose
money and dilute the other half's genuine edge. This plan removes the drag.

## 1. The evidence — what actually separates winners from losers now

### 1a. `entry_atr_pct` (ATR% at entry, honestly captured at entry) — THE signal

Post-fix window, monotonic across buckets:

| entry ATR% | n | win% | cum PnL% |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 0.10 | 20 | 35.0 | −0.74 |
| 0.10 – 0.20 | 81 | 46.9 | −4.36 |
| 0.20 – 0.30 | 17 | 58.8 | −0.40 |
| 0.30 – 0.50 | 41 | **70.7** | **+7.63** |
| ≥ 0.50 | 51 | 64.7 | +6.27 |

Single split at **0.25**: kept 103 trades → **68.0% win, +14.59%** ; dropped
111 → 45.0% win, −5.80%. At **0.20**: kept 109 → 66.1% win, +13.49%; dropped
105 → 45.7%, −4.70%. Pre-fix window agrees directionally (kept −1.15% vs
dropped −2.16%; win 60.7% vs 42.9%). The entire post-fix profit lives in the
ATR ≥ 0.20 book.

**Mechanism (not just correlation):** a coin with entry ATR ≤ 0.2% is barely
moving. Its TP is structurally hard to reach before stall/timeout, fees eat
the small wins (~0.11% round trip vs +0.24% avg win pre-fix), and the losers
grind out through `loss_stall`/`timeout`. This is the same "dead tape"
failure identified independently by the fee-drag analysis and the June
diagnosis.

**Fine print (honest):** within-symbol validation was not possible — no
symbol had ≥5 trades on both sides of 0.25 in this window, so the filter
partly selects *which coins are currently moving* rather than timing within
a coin. That is acceptable here: it is exactly the selectivity requested,
and ATR is a live property (a coin crosses the line as its volatility
changes — this is NOT a static coin ban list). Risk mitigated by
observe-first rollout (§3 Phase A).

### 1b. Entry-time volume_ratio — floor only, do NOT raise (honest negative)

Joining all 110 executed trades since the gate went live to their true
entry-time vr from `ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE` logs: winners median 0.998, losers
median 1.070 — **no gradient above the 0.30 floor**. The strong separation
in the original 371-trade analysis came from `trade_intelligence.volume_ratio`,
which §4 of this doc corrects: that column is captured at **close** (TIAS
collector runs from `on_trade_closed`), and winners systematically close on
volume expansion (TP hits) while stall-losers close in dead tape — a
close-time confound. Decision: **keep `min_volume_ratio = 0.30`** as a
dead-tape floor (the gate has blocked 209 of 546 proposals, including
vr=0.02 entries that are indefensible), **do not raise it**.

### 1c. The brain's own confidence is still inverted — cannot be the selector

`claude_confidence`: losers median 0.515 vs winners 0.470 (post-fix). Any
"take only confident trades" logic keyed on the model's self-reported
confidence would select the WRONG trades. Selectivity must come from
market-measured features (ATR), not model self-assessment.

### 1d. Hold time: trades that work, work immediately (re-confirmed post-fix)

<10 min: 74.1% win, +12.50%. 10–20 min: 43.1% win, −2.55%. >20 min: 24.3%
win, −1.16%. A trade that hasn't worked by ~12 min is a coin flip decaying
toward certain loss.

### 1e. Sizing is anti-correlated with outcome

Losers are sized larger than winners (median $194 vs $168 in the 371-trade
baseline; the conviction that drives size up is the same inverted confidence
from 1c). The brain is betting biggest on its worst ideas.

### 1f. Cleared of suspicion (do not touch)

- **strategic_review closes** — the 8 post-fix losers were violent adverse
  moves (−1.2 to −1.9% within 5–12 min, most never green) on high-ATR coins;
  review closed them FAST. It is a rescue mechanism working, same verdict as
  `win_prob_near_certain`. 6 of 8 would NOT have been caught by the ATR
  filter (they had high ATR) — they are the cost of trading moving coins,
  and the R:R math absorbs them (B3/XEC are net-positive symbols overall).
- **Re-entry after loss ("revenge trading")** — 57 such trades net +4.20%.
  Not a leak. No cooldown changes needed.
- **Exit system** — sixth consecutive analysis confirming exits are fine.

---

## 2. Design decisions

1. **One lever at a time.** Ship the ATR gate alone, measure, then decide on
   sizing (Phase B) and time-fuse (Phase C). Shipping all three at once makes
   attribution impossible.
2. **Reuse the existing gate machinery.** `src/core/entry_volume_gate.py` +
   the `[entry_volume_gate]` config section + the strategy_worker wiring are
   deployed, tested, and already fetch the exact TA result that contains
   `natr_14` (entry ATR). Add an ATR check to the same gate rather than
   building a parallel one.
3. **Independent modes per check.** The vr check stays `enforce`; the new ATR
   check gets its own `atr_mode` so it can observe while vr keeps enforcing.
4. **Observe-first this time.** The vr gate's enforce-on-day-one shortcut was
   the operator's call and it worked out, but 1a's within-symbol gap is a
   real unknown. 24–48h of `would_block` logging on live proposals costs
   nothing and directly measures the kept/dropped split before any trade is
   refused.

## 3. Phases

### Phase A — ATR entry gate (the main event)

**A1. Extend the gate module** (`src/core/entry_volume_gate.py`):
`evaluate_entry_quality_gate(volume_ratio, atr_pct, min_volume_ratio,
min_atr_pct, ...)` returning per-check verdicts + a combined `would_block`.
Fail-open on missing ATR (same convention). Pure function, extend the
existing tests.

**A2. Config** (`[entry_volume_gate]`, keeping the section name for
compatibility):
```toml
min_atr_pct = 0.20      # start conservative; 0 = check disabled
atr_mode = "observe"    # flip to "enforce" after A4 review
```

**A3. Wiring** — same place in `_execute_claude_trade`: the TA result is
already fetched for vr; read `(_evg_ta.get("volatility") or {}).get("natr_14")`
from the SAME result (zero extra TA calls). Extend the `ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE`
log line with `atr=… atr_would_block=…`.

**A4. Review after 24–48h of observe data** (≥150 proposals): compute the
would-block cohort's realized PnL from the log join. Exit criteria to
enforce: kept-book win% ≥ 60 AND dropped-book cum PnL < 0. Then flip
`atr_mode = "enforce"`.

**A5. Tune 0.20 → 0.25** only after ≥200 enforced trades, from archive data.

**Projected effect (in-sample, treat as estimate not promise):** trade count
roughly halves (~107/day → ~50/day); win% ~56 → ~66-68; the −4.7 to −5.8%
daily drag from the low-ATR book disappears.

### Phase B — sizing sanity (after A is enforced and measured)

Investigate what drives `size_usd` dispersion (brain conviction sizing under
brain-authoritative mode). Evidence says conviction-scaled size is value-
destroying while confidence stays inverted (1c/1e). Candidate fix: flatten
per-trade size toward the median (narrow band), keeping total exposure
unchanged. Requires its own small analysis + operator sign-off since it
touches the sacred sizing philosophy ([apex] brain-authoritative sizing,
operator decision 2026-05-31).

### Phase C — time-fuse (only if needed after A+B)

If the >12-min book is still a coin flip after the ATR gate (it may fix
itself — dead coins are the ones that stall), tighten the `loss_stall` fuse
so flat-at-12-min trades exit at scratch instead of decaying. Do not touch
before A/B are attributed — the exit system is calibrated and every prior
"fix the exit" instinct has been wrong.

### Explicit non-actions (as important as the actions)

- Do NOT raise `min_volume_ratio` above 0.30 (1b — no gradient).
- Do NOT use `claude_confidence` for anything selective (1c — inverted).
- Do NOT add re-entry cooldowns (1f — revenge trades are net positive).
- Do NOT ban individual symbols (1000XECUSDT is simultaneously the biggest
  strategic_review loser AND the 2nd-best symbol; static bans select on
  noise).
- Do NOT touch the R:R config (`d1b1561`) — it flipped the book positive.

## 4. Correction to the record: `trade_intelligence.volume_ratio` is close-time

The TIAS collector (`src/tias/collector.py`, invoked from
`TradeCoordinator.on_trade_closed`) captures the unprefixed TA columns
(`volume_ratio`, `rsi`, `adx`, …) at trade **close**, not entry. Only the
`entry_*`-prefixed columns are entry-time. The original 371-trade volume
analysis unknowingly used close-time data, which inflated the separation
(§1b). The vr gate survives on its floor-level merits, but all future
entry-feature research MUST use either `entry_*` columns or the
`ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE` log join. Consider adding `entry_volume_ratio` to the
coordinator's entry capture (one line next to `entry_atr_pct`) so the honest
feature lands in the DB for free.

## 5. Measurement protocol

- Daily: archived CSVs (`data/trade_logs/archive/`) → win%, avg win/loss,
  net PnL, split by kept/dropped cohort.
- Checkpoints at ~200 enforced trades per phase before the next lever.
- Success for the plan overall: win% ≥ 60, avg-win/avg-loss ≥ 1.2, net
  positive after fees on a ≥400-trade sample.
- Rollback for every phase is config-only (`atr_mode="observe"`, or
  `min_atr_pct=0`).

## 6. Implementation record (2026-07-16)

Operator directed completing all three phases in one session. Phase A
shipped; Phase B and Phase C were investigated in full but NOT
implemented — in both cases the evidence that justified the phase in
§1 did not survive a closer look at the actual live mechanism, and
shipping a fix for a problem that isn't really there would be exactly
the "band-aid" this project's rules forbid, and would work against the
operator's actual goal (genuine accuracy, not motion for its own sake).

### Phase A — ATR gate: IMPLEMENTED

- `src/core/entry_volume_gate.py`: added `ATRGateResult` +
  `evaluate_entry_atr_gate(atr_pct, min_atr_pct)`, mirroring the existing
  volume-ratio gate's shape/fail-open convention exactly.
- `src/config/settings.py`: extended `EntryVolumeGateSettings` with
  `atr_enabled` / `atr_mode` / `min_atr_pct` (independent of the
  volume-ratio gate's own `enabled`/`mode`). Builder already used the
  generic `hasattr`-filtered pattern — no change needed there.
- `config.toml [entry_volume_gate]`: added `atr_enabled=true
  atr_mode="enforce" min_atr_pct=0.20`. Operator decision recorded
  inline: enforcing on first deploy, same trade-off as the volume gate.
- `src/workers/strategy_worker.py`: restructured the gate block so the
  TA fetch happens once and feeds both gates independently (each with
  its own enabled/mode check, own log line — `ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE` and
  the new `ENTRY_ATR_GATE` — and own enforcement branch). Reads
  `natr_14` from the volatility block of the SAME already-fetched TA
  result — zero added TA cost. New reason code
  `entry_atr_gate_blocked` added to the function's documented enum.
- `tests/test_entry_volume_gate.py`: 8 new tests for the ATR gate
  (threshold boundary, fail-open, kill-switch, settings validation),
  mirroring the volume-gate test structure.
- **Verified:** `py_compile` clean, `ruff --select F` clean (only a
  pre-existing unrelated unused-import finding), `Settings._load_fresh`
  round-trips both gates' config correctly, 63/63 relevant tests pass.

### Phase B — sizing: INVESTIGATED, NOT IMPLEMENTED

§1e's premise ("losers sized larger, median $194 vs $168") came from the
OLD 371-trade pre-fix baseline and was assumed to be driven by
conviction-weighted sizing amplifying the brain's (inverted) confidence.
Tracing the actual live code path in `src/apex/gate.py` disproved both
halves of that assumption:

1. **The conviction-weighting code is inert in live config.** Under
   `brain_authoritative_sizing_enabled=true` (confirmed live in
   `config.toml`), the entire conviction-weight block (TIAS profit
   factor, X-RAY confidence, RR multipliers) is computed and then
   explicitly discarded — the code's own comment says so
   (`gate.py` ~line 517: "under the live brain_authoritative_sizing_
   enabled=true mode this whole weight is computed then discarded").
   Live `size_usd` is the brain's raw proposed value, clamped only by a
   FIXED per-trade capital ceiling (`usable / max_positions`) —
   independent of any conviction signal. The real driver, if there were
   one, would have to be the brain's own free-form JSON choice, guided
   by the prompt's "scaled by conviction" instruction (`strategist.py`
   rule 9 / line ~399).
2. **The size/outcome correlation does not replicate on fresh data.**
   Post-R:R-fix (`position_size_usd`, the correct field — not `pnl_usd`-
   derived): winner median $173 vs loser median $161 — nearly identical
   — and `corr(size, pnl_pct) = -0.034` across 214 trades, essentially
   zero. Sizing is currently neutral, not harmful.

No code change made. The prompt's "scale by conviction" instruction is a
legitimate strategy (small size on quick scalps, more on strong setups)
and collapsing it into a flat band would blunt the system's ability to
size up on Phase-A-validated high-quality setups — the opposite of the
selectivity goal. Revisit only if a future window shows the correlation
re-emerging, with `position_size_usd` (not a derived field).

### Phase C — time-fuse: INVESTIGATED, NOT IMPLEMENTED

§1d's hold-time decay (10-20min 43% win / -2.55%, >20min 24% win /
-1.16%) was hypothesized to need a tighter stall-cut fuse. Two checks
before touching the TimeDial (`src/core/time_dial.py`,
`stall_min_age_fraction_young/old`, an already heavily-tuned,
safety-critical parameter with explicit in-code history of prior
over-tightening incidents — "the veto is what stops this becoming the
new over-tightening"):

1. **`_lc_stall_decision` only ever fires on already-negative trades**
   (`profit_sniper.py`: `if pnl_pct >= 0: return False`). There is no
   existing mechanism that scratches a flat/breakeven trade on time
   alone — the described decay is trades that are ALREADY losing taking
   longer to resolve, not healthy trades going stale.
2. **Phase A's ATR gate already substantially fixes this pattern.**
   68% of the 10-20min bucket's losers and 61% of the >20min bucket's
   losers had `entry_atr_pct < 0.20` — they would already be blocked by
   the Phase A gate. Retroactively applying the ATR filter to those
   hold-time buckets flips them from clearly negative (-2.55%, -1.16%
   cum) to positive/near-breakeven (+2.44%, +0.22% cum, though the
   remaining >20min sample is thin at n=17). Dead-tape coins are
   simultaneously the ones that can't hit TP fast (so they linger) AND
   the ones the `dead_drifter`/`stall` machinery (already enabled,
   `dead_drifter_age_fraction=0.70`) waits longest to act on, since the
   TimeDial is deliberately patient early in a trade's life.

No code change made. Re-tuning a delicate, already-painfully-tuned exit
parameter on correlational hold-time data — when the much simpler,
already-shipped Phase A explains most of the pattern — would be
premature. Revisit only with fresh post-Phase-A data if the late-hold
bucket is still a problem once dead-tape entries are actually gone.

---

## 7. Phase A deploy + live verification (2026-07-16)

Deployed to the VM (`git pull` → `da2002c`, restart `trading-workers` +
`trading-brain` at 16:14:51 UTC). Pre-restart: `py_compile` clean,
`Settings._load_fresh` confirmed `atr_enabled=True atr_mode=enforce
min_atr_pct=0.20` from the real deployed `config.toml`. Post-restart:
zero new errors (the two warnings seen — a ticker-buffer flush failure
and a transient shadow-DB lock — are both pre-existing, confirmed
present in logs going back to 2026-07-09, unrelated to this change).

**Verification had two stages**, because the first several trades
proposed after restart all happened to be dead-tape coins that the
volume-ratio gate blocked before the (downstream) ATR check ever ran:

1. **Isolated mechanism proof** — direct live-data test via `TACache`
   against the VM's real `trading.db`, independent of waiting for the
   brain to propose a qualifying trade:
   ```
   BTCUSDT: vr=1.888266 atr=0.071781 | vr_verdict=pass atr_verdict=block
   ```
   BTC had strong volume (would pass the volume gate alone) but genuinely
   flat price action (0.072% ATR) — exactly the "active tape, not
   actually moving" case the volume gate alone cannot see. Confirms the
   ATR gate does real, independent work, not redundant with the volume
   gate.

2. **Live end-to-end confirmation** — at 16:30:45 UTC a real proposed
   trade (TRXUSDT, `did=d-1784219429314`) passed the volume gate then
   was correctly caught by the ATR gate:
   ```
   ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE | sym=TRXUSDT vr=1.883986 verdict=pass
   ENTRY_ATR_GATE | sym=TRXUSDT atr=0.039689 thr=0.20 verdict=block
     would_block=True reason=atr_pct_below_threshold
   ```
   Pre-Phase-A this trade would have executed (it already cleared every
   other gate). Now correctly blocked: 0.04% ATR is deep in the "can't
   reach TP before fees/stall erode it" zone from §1a.

**Current live status:** both gates enforcing — volume-ratio @ 0.30,
ATR @ 0.20. Next milestone: revisit thresholds and the Phase C question
(§6) once ~200 enforced trades have accumulated post-deploy.

---

## 8. Recent-loss gate: forensic trace + implementation (2026-07-17)

Less than 24h after the Phase A deploy, the operator asked for a
before/after comparison. Direct answer: the post-ATR-gate window was
worse on the surface (net -8.77% vs +7.42% pre-gate, R:R 0.49x vs
0.99x, same win rate 55.2%) — but 87% of that loss (-$34.31 of -$39.29)
came from one symbol, GWEIUSDT, over 9 trades in ~21 hours. The operator
asked for a full forensic trace of every GWEIUSDT trade and, if the
pattern was avoidable, a code fix — not a threshold retune.

### What the forensic trace found

Pulled `trade_thesis` (full reasoning text, SL/TP, setup type) for
every GWEIUSDT trade since the Phase A restart. Every single trade was
a **short**. Nearly every thesis contains the same sentence structure:
*"despite the conflicting buy signal... structure and regime are
authoritative"* — the brain explicitly notices its own signal layer
disagreeing and overrides it, repeatedly, in the same direction, on
the same coin. One thesis (03:49:02 UTC) reads verbatim: *"Despite
RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN, the setup quality is B and the action hint
suggests short-side pullback continuation."*

That sentence proves two things at once: (1) a `RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN`
mechanism already exists, and (2) it did not stop the trade. Tracing
the codebase found **two** existing mechanisms, both bypassed:

1. **`strategist.py:636`** — a prompt rule: *"closed at a loss within
   1h — do NOT re-enter on sentiment or regime alone; require fresh,
   independent per-coin structure."* This is advisory text in the LLM
   prompt. The free-tier model can rationalize past it — and did,
   explicitly, in its own words.
2. **`scanner_worker._check_blockers`** — a real code-level qualitative
   blocker (`recent_failure_blocker_hours=1`, live in `config.toml`),
   which genuinely excludes a coin from the scanner's watchlist
   ("Empty list = pass; non-empty = block the coin from selection").
   This SHOULD have caught it. It sits upstream in the pipeline
   (watchlist qualification), and three consecutive GWEIUSDT shorts
   still closed at -1.76%, -1.90%, -1.94% within 59 minutes of each
   other — meaning something in the qualification→candidate-selection
   chain let the coin through anyway (force-include, protected-position
   path, or a gap between watchlist qualification and final candidate
   selection were not fully traced — out of scope once a more robust
   fix was identified, see below).

Rather than debug an upstream pipeline with multiple possible bypass
paths, the same design principle from the volume/ATR gates applies:
put the check at the **last point before order placement**, immune to
whatever bypassed it upstream.

### Implementation

Third gate in the same family (`src/core/entry_volume_gate.py`,
`EntryVolumeGateSettings`, `strategy_worker._execute_claude_trade`),
same pattern as Phase A: pure evaluator (`evaluate_recent_loss_gate`),
config-driven (`recent_loss_enabled` / `recent_loss_mode` /
`recent_loss_lookback_hours` / `max_recent_losses`), independent
enforce/observe mode, instant kill switch, fully logged
(`ENTRY_RECENT_LOSS_GATE`). Unlike the TA-based gates it runs a direct
DB query against `trade_log` (not `ta_cache`) — chosen specifically
because `trade_log` is written synchronously at close with no TIAS/LLM
analysis dependency, avoiding a latency blind-spot that would have
undermined the whole point of a "last-mile, unbypassable" check.

Thresholds (`lookback_hours=1.0`, `max_recent_losses=1`) are not new
invented numbers — they encode the *existing* `RECENT_LOSER_COOLDOWN`
prompt rule's own stated intent exactly. This is that rule, finally
enforced in code instead of hoped for in the prompt.

**A real bug was caught before deploy, not after:** the first version
compared `closed_at` (stored ISO-8601 with a `T` separator, e.g.
`"...T18:06:16.526042+00:00"`) against `datetime('now', ?)`'s
space-separated output as a raw string. Since `'T' (0x54) > ' ' (0x20)`
in ASCII, every same-day `closed_at` sorted as "later" than the
reference regardless of actual time-of-day — silently turning a
1-hour lookback into "any time today." Caught by testing the exact
production query against live VM data before shipping (a direct
lesson from the `IMPLEMENT_ENTRY_VOLUME_GATE.md` §9 UnboundLocalError
incident: test against real data, not just unit tests with clean
inputs). Fixed with `julianday()` on both sides, which parses either
timestamp format into a comparable numeric value. Re-verified against
the actual GWEIUSDT sequence: **the corrected query would have blocked
the 18:30:22 and 19:02:25 re-entries** (1 and 2 prior same-direction
losses respectively, both `>= max_recent_losses=1`) — the two trades
that cost -1.895% and -1.944%, roughly 44% of the whole window's
damage, from enforcing a rule that already existed on paper.

**Verified:** `py_compile` clean, `ruff --select F` clean (same
pre-existing unrelated finding), the corrected query re-tested against
4 points in the real GWEIUSDT sequence (all 4 match hand-computed
expected counts exactly), 72/72 relevant tests pass (8 new).

**Live deploy verification (2026-07-17):** pulled `b4992d9` on the VM,
compile + config round-trip clean (`recent_loss: True enforce 1.0 1`),
restarted `trading-workers`/`trading-brain` with zero new errors (the
`STRAT_CALL_A_FAIL 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` lines in
brain.log predate this deploy — present since Jul 15). First live
firing came within the hour and was a real block:
```
ENTRY_RECENT_LOSS_GATE | sym=KAITOUSDT dir=Buy count=1 lookback_h=1.00
  thr=1 mode=enforce verdict=block would_block=True
  reason=recent_loss_threshold_reached
```
A KAITOUSDT buy re-entry after a same-direction loss within the hour —
the exact GWEIUSDT pattern, caught on a different coin. Zero
`ENTRY_RECENT_LOSS_GATE_QUERY_FAIL` occurrences (the julianday fix
holds in production).

**All three gates now enforcing live:** volume-ratio @ 0.30, ATR @
0.20, recent-loss @ max 1 same-(symbol,direction) loss per rolling
hour.

### Root-cause note (operator question, 2026-07-17): why did the brain
### keep selling GWEIUSDT instead of buying?

The buy call WAS made — by the signal layer, every time (theses read
"despite the conflicting buy signal", "though signal is strong_buy").
The brain overrode it because the prompt hierarchy makes per-coin
regime + structure authoritative over the signal layer (rule 6 — a
deliberate design to stop counter-trend bounce-buying in genuine
downtrends). The failure mode: GWEIUSDT's `trending_down` label (0.80
conf) was honestly earned earlier, but regime detection lags — when
the coin reversed and rallied ~8%, the stale label kept telling the
brain "downtrend", each rally leg got reinterpreted as "short-side
pullback continuation" (rising price = better short entry), and the
weak structural evidence backing the shorts (X-RAY conf 0.3-0.4 vs
0.70 baseline) was still granted full authority. Auto-flipping to the
signal direction was considered and rejected (contrarian auto-flip is
its own new failure mode); the recent-loss gate implements the safer
"stand aside on repeated same-direction losses" response instead.
Candidate deeper fix if post-gate data still shows the pattern:
treat repeated signal-vs-regime conflict + same-direction losses as
evidence the regime label is stale (force a per-coin regime refresh,
or strip regime authority for that coin temporarily). Deferred pending
gate data.
